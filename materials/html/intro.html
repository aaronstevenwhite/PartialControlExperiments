In this experiment, you'll be reading sentences and judging whether
they are acceptable. <b>An "acceptable" sentence is something a native
    speaker of English would say, even if the situation the
sentence describes sounds implausible</b>. For example, here's an acceptable sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Frank wondered what he should eat with.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Even though a middle school English teacher might tell you that you can't end a sentence with a preposition, native speakers of English do so all the time and it sounds perfectly natural. In fact, the "proper" version of that sentence sounds pretty weird: 
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Frank wondered with what he should eat.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>An unacceptable sentence is one that no native speaker of English would produce</b>. Here are some examples of less acceptable sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Frank wondered what he should eat bananas and.</i></li>
<li><i>Frank was eager what he should eat.</i></li>
<li><i>Frank wondered what he should eat how.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
During the course of the experiment, you'll see both some perfectly acceptable sentences as well as some very unacceptable ones. You might also see some sentences that you feel are "okay but not great" or "pretty good but not perfect". Because sentences often come with these different shades of acceptability, you'll have a scale from 1 (awful) to 7 (perfect) to choose from. So if a sentence is "pretty good but not perfect", you might give it a 5 or a 6; while if a sentence was "marginal but not awful", you might give it a 2 or a 3.     
</p>

<p>
Make sure to read the sentences carefully. Some of them might sound better if you take words out; but <b>every word is purposeful, and you should rate the sentence according to all the words present</b>. For instance:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Sandy drove the car for to the main office.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
This sentence would sound much better without the <i>for</i> or without the <i>to</i>, but it is pretty unacceptable with both. 
</p>

The experiment will start with 3 practice trials to get you warmed up. After that you will see a screen letting you know that the experiment is about to begin. You will then be given 168 sentences in total. This shouldn't take you much longer than 25 minutes to complete.
